AITER is AMDâ€™s centralized repository that support various of high performance AI operators for AI workloads acceleration, where a good unified place for all the customer operator-level requests, which can match different customers' needs. Developers can focus on operators, and let the customers integrate this op collection into their own private/public/whatever framework.
 

Some summary of the features:
* C++ level API
* Python level API
* The underneath kernel could from triton/ck/asm
* Not only inference kernels, but also training kernels and gemm+comm kerenls (so can do any kerne+framework dirty WAs for any arch limit)
